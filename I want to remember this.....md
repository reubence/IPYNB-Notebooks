    - ### Useful Communication Techniques
        - **Mange your anxiety by doing something that calms you down **
            - You could count backwards from 17.
            - You could try to talk by spelling out words by each letter instead of speaking them as a whole
            - You could also try to recite tongue twisters
            - **All these things force your mind to latch on to the present moment instead of worrying about the future**
        - **See the interactions as an opportunity and not a challenge**
        - **Take the time to listen to your audience**
            - Use simple conversational language.
            - Instead of saying __"Thus it would make sense to to consider investing in shares"__. You could say __"This is why you should consider investing in shares!"__

Here the **"you"** here is important as it engages the audience to listen.
            - Another thing to remember is always start by asking a few questions, this also helps in engaging the audience to listen.
            - 
        - **Use Structure to set up expectations for the audience**
            - It is important to present a structure to your audience so that they know **what **to expect.
            - Take for example a tour guide who starts off by giving you a brief about the places you will be visiting before the tour starts. This helps set up expectations.
            - A few structure techniques are as follow:-
                - **Problem -> Solution -> Benefit**
                - **What? -> So what? -> Now what?** / **Who ? Why? What? **
                    - What is it ?   / Who they are?
                    - Why is it imp?     / Why are they imp?
                    - What are the next step  / What do they do

- # Data Science
    - ### Voice Analytics
        - ### Some domains where we can use Speech Analytics
            - **Information Governance**
            - **Healthcare and Education**
            - **Product Imporvement**
                - Can you analyse calls on the go and provide the caller with the live suggestions of things he can/could've said.
                - Say for amazon, we can extract info about what the people are talking about. What are their complains. 
                - Sentiment analysis - Calls with Jio, Vodafone, Airtel and all customers are usually angry with their service provider on the call.

Can we find out what questions i should ask the customer based on his tone, verbatim, etc.

Eg: Person calls Vodafone and says "Your service is shit, Airtel is better".
Here we can track what people are saying about the brand, How is the overall customer engagement and overall brand perception,
            - **Lead Scoring**
                - Building a ML model and training it to assign a lead score to each new call based on previous data from past leads with similar behaviour within the calls
            - **Agent Analysis in Telecom & Insurance**
                - Training an algorithm to understand what the agent says, and tell us whether they require more training on certain subjects.
        - ### How does Voice Analytics help in Contact Centres?
            - **Deliver personalized customer experiences**
                - We require a voice agent that can analyse the call on-the-go and tell the agent what he must say next using maybe the past history of the customer thgrough which we can know what the customer likes.
            - **Competitive Intelligence**
                - A backend solution that can analyse the competitor and leverage the knowledge to suggest better plans to customers on the go
            - **24/7 Customer Service AI Bot**
                - A bot to answer most frequently answered questions
            - **Solve customer problems quickly**
                - With an AI aid on the screen, the agent can take decisions quickly and solve the customer's problems more quickly.
                - Also we can use Speech Analytics to monitor calls and understand how many problems have actually been solved.
            - **Personalize training for agents**
                - The Bot ca
            - **Replace IVR**
            - **Review calls in depth**
        - ### Solving a Data Science Problem in a Business Enviorment
            - **Understand the business**
                - What is the thing that the Client wants? 
                - What is the thing that the Customer wants? 
                - What is the Business outcome that they want?
                - **__Ask the right question__**
                - **__Finalise the problem statement__**
            - **Get your data**
                - Finalise the features or dataset required by discussing it with Client.
                - Mention the issues / risks to the Client.
            - **Exploring and Cleaning the Data**
                - Understand what each and every column means
            - **Define KPIs and Right Algorithms**
                - Define the right algorithms or their category of implementation by carefully considering the features in the dataset and the problem statement and how it would impact the objectives.
                - Use explainable algorithms. Maximize the use of algorithms that are more explainable. The trade-off here is that the model will either be to flexible or interpretable. 
            - **Showcase End Results**
                - Provide client with easy to grasp and presentable results using right visualizations.
        - ### Voice Analytics Use Case
            - **A Large UK based Financial Services firm providing expense management solution was required to assess data that comes from Omi-Channel distribution - Calls, Emails, Chat. It was impossible to manually understand customer needs as the number of calls per day range from 10k to 50k**
                - Come up with a model that can come up with questions, sentiment analysis, products on a live-call. Basically recommendations. An insight that we can.
Real-time notification to the Agents.
                - Granular level issue understand is very important in Voice Analytics use case.
                - The solution should always be in the form of KPIs. How will the customer benefit or How will the company benefit if they do this. 
                - Diarize the speaker:  Meaning who is the customer and who is the agent.
                - The basic problem statement is that understand the customer problems and act upon it.
